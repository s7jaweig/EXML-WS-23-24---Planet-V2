## Implementation of the Geoplots

This repository contains scripts for generating a geoplot for the top 5 prediction of PlaNet network. It creates 6 plots in one image. The first plot is an overview plot and the other plots are detailed plots for each prediction.

The code runs in Matlab. All required files and folder structures are included here and should not be changed.

### Prerequisites
- Matlab
- geoplot modul

### Usage
1. Copy the results of PlaNet for the Geoplots in the `Input` folder
2. Fill in the imagenames in the array in `Geoplots.m` and run the script
3. You find the result image in the folder `Output`
